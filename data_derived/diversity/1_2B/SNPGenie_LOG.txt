If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, T prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_1_2B.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	21059	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -10. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
