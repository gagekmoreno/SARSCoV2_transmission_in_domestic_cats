N/A	gene-ORF1ab	13429	Mid-sequence STOP codon. Please check your annotations for: (1) incorrect frame; or (2) incorrect starting or ending coordinates. A premature STOP codon may also indicate a pseudogene, for which piN vs. piS analysis may not be appropriate.
temp_vcf4_6_10A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	1710	No SNPs in >=1000 contiguous codons. If this was unexpected, you may need to specify Unix (\n) newline characters! See Troubleshooting
temp_vcf4_6_10A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	18112	No SNPs in >=1000 contiguous codons. If this was unexpected, you may need to specify Unix (\n) newline characters! See Troubleshooting
