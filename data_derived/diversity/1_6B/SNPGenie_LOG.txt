temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF3a	25812	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -14. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF3a	25812	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of A nucleotides of -1. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, A prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF3a	25810	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 200.00%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF8	28004	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -60. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF8	28004	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of A nucleotides of -2. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, A prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-ORF8	28002	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 300.00%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported
temp_vcf4_1_6B.vcf	gene-S	21733	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of T nucleotides: -13. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; T count set to 0; proceed with caution.
