temp_vcf4_6_7B.vcf	NA	520	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -11. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7B.vcf	NA	520	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of A nucleotides of -1. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, A prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7B.vcf	NA	553	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -12. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
