temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	1609	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of C nucleotides: -574. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; C count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	1609	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of C nucleotides of -0.996527777777778. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, C prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	4077	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -12. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	4077	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of A nucleotides of -1. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, A prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	1609	Coverage (576.000) does not equal the nucleotide sum (1150.000).
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	NA	4077	Coverage (12.000) does not equal the nucleotide sum (24.000).
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	1609	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of C nucleotides: -574. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; C count set to 0; proceed with caution.

N/A	gene-ORF1ab	13429	Mid-sequence STOP codon. Please check your annotations for: (1) incorrect frame; or (2) incorrect starting or ending coordinates. A premature STOP codon may also indicate a pseudogene, for which piN vs. piS analysis may not be appropriate.
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	1608	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 199.65%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported

temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	3108	No SNPs in >=1000 contiguous codons. If this was unexpected, you may need to specify Unix (\n) newline characters! See Troubleshooting
temp_vcf4_6_7A.vcf	gene-ORF1ab	4076	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 200.00%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported
