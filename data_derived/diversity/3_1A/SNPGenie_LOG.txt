temp_vcf4_3_1A.vcf	gene-ORF3a	25812	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -11. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; A count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_3_1A.vcf	gene-ORF3a	25812	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of A nucleotides of -1.

If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, A prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
