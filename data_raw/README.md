# Raw data

To accompany the manuscript entitled "Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats imposes a narrow bottleneck"

The raw fastqs have been submitted to the SRA under bioproject [PRJNA666926](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/666926).

Fastqs were generated on an Illumina MiSeq 300x300bp paired-read sequencing. 

There are forward and reverse fastq files for each cat (cats 1 through 6) as well as each timepoint (DPI 1 through 8 for index cats and 3 through 10 for contact cats). Each sample was sequenced in complete technical replicate (replicates A and B).
